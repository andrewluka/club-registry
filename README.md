# Club Registry

This project was based off of [this sample](https://github.com/yhirose/react-typescript-electron-sample-with-create-react-app-and-electron-builder).

This a program that was built to keep track of games and users in a club: users can borrow and return games. Users and games must be added beforehand though.

Also, there is the concept of a session, which is the time from the start till the end of a session. Sessions help in gaining insight over who attends the club, and when do they arrive (late, early).
